The best green ice tea on the market with the Lipton brand you love and some cool flavours.; I love these Lipton ice teas - they help me get off diet coke which I was getting addicted to. Great taste and for a great price.;  No issues at all excellent product for the price and prompt delivery is always a bonus - makes an excellent change for a drink during lockdown and WFH; Boyfriend is in love with this juice.
Would drink the whole lot in a day.
Great flavour, good design & well priced.
All round just great.
Always arrived in good shape too, nothing damaged or leaking.; My favourite drink, icey straight from the fridge. Good price point of £10 for 12. Please dont go up!; volume for price; I love this product great price; Bulk nxt day delivery is what I like, pre lockdown; i love this drink. not a lot of places in the UK sell it, not even the supermarkets. even though its very popular in Europe i cant find it here in the UK..

thats why im so happy that Amazon sell it. for a good price too; great in the hot weather with ice.cooling.lemon taste.delicouse and thirst quenching.cant get this where I live .RECOMMEND

ASHAME AMAZON BUCKED UP THE PRICE PER PACK OF TWELVE BY AN EXTRA £4.00; Love this drink and at a good price; My kids like this stuff and it's not fizzy which I like for them. Can't seem to buy it in bulk anywhere so good on Amazon!; Excellent flavour and price. Didn't last very long coz the kids found it and liked it too !; Love ice tea but this really is the best flavour, it's hard to come across this flavour and the green tea flavour in the shops but it's a good price for 12 delivered to your door.; the taste is really nice and the price is cheap.; very nice and low price and fast delivery; If you like Ice tea, this is one of the best out there, well priced and well packed for delivery.; Very pleased have. not had this flaovour before very good .
Very good price.; Good price; Great product with a great taste also great company and also a great price.; A tasty drink that we can't seem to find in any of the supermarkets near us. They're a good price for the number you get in the pack and it's really helpful that they come with Prime delivery too.","2.0 out of 5 stars WAY Too Expensive, Ridiculous Price, Disgusting,  Blatant profiteering,  ","I had a dumb moment and ordered without checking the volume size. I thought at that price I was ordering 12 large bottles, until they arrived and now I feel ripped off. £17 for 12 small bottles?! The large bottles are £1.50 in the shops, 12 LARGE BOTTLES make roughly the same price as these 12 small bottles.; Product is a reasonable price and came quickly but on opening it had been packed with 11 bottles not 12 as stated. The plastic wrap had been broken and one taken out ( the outer box not damaged so happened at packing stage). Remaining bottles are fine and the peach iced tea is lovely.; till don't think you realize how ridiculous the pricing is on these Mango tea products.; 2 of the bottles had floaty bits inside it. They looked like plastic waste in the ocean, absolutely disgusting. Although this is only 2 of 12 bottles, its still unacceptable since this price isn't exactly very cheap.; Love the taste but the delivery was very late and each bottle had a recommended retail price of £1:09 printed on it while the supplier charged £16:99 for 12, (£1.416 per bottle), I actually think this is illegal, I certainly won’t be buying from them again."

Good price too.; Daughter first time trying this flavour and she enjoyed it; A huge fan of Liptons ice tea, although it's getting impossible to buy it anywhere! This is the cheapest I have found it on Internet.

Better than a big brand we all know
Pricing is very resonable to
10/10","Great taste, poor value - thought I was buying 12x1L like Sainsburys sell at same price not 12x500ml,  Revolving Lids!, Premium Tea, ","I like the taste but a 12pack from the manufacturer should be cheaper than you can buy it at the corner shop in singles. Sainsburys sell the 1L at this price, thought that is what I was buying :(; Lovely, refreshing flavour - better than Lipton - however, disappointingly faulty lids that several times failed to open properly. Had to resort to a sharp knife to cut the plastic lugs, often resulting in spilled beverage. This is priced as a premium product, so the packaging disappoints.; It is a premium product compared to other brands such as Lipton and I don't think the taste is much better to warrant the extra price. It is your standard bottled iced tea at a premium pricing.

I also think the bottles are less durable and poorer quality than other products on the market including Lipton which is a firmer, solid plastic.

The taste is A-OK, the price is premium and the product looks cheap."

5.0 out of 5 stars Delicious","I've tried many brands of iced tea and Liptons is always the best. All of their flavoured iced tea has a nice flavour blend of sweet tea and real fruit and this raspberry variety is no exception. The raspberry flavour is close to the taste of real raspberries, with a nice sour kick to it too.
The only reason for not giving this five stars is Amazon is selling this, (with Amazon as the seller), exact same iced tea twice under two different prices. Annoyingly I bought this 12 pack from Amazon Pantry for £12.11 when it's also listed for sale by Amazon Prime for £10.; My favourite flavour Lipton Iced tea which is sadly hard to find at supermarkets - it is an incredible price too at under £7 for 12 bottles, if you buy the right quantity you can end up paying under 50p a bottle with delivery and that's fantastic value, especially compared to other flavours.; Great price, as described; Great price; Great service good price; One of my favourite flavours in the Lipton brand, however, the Amazon price is slightly more expensive with many in-store retailers selling the same quantity on multi-buy for between £0.9 and £1 each.; Bottles marked at a £1. The case of 12 cost £14. That should have been reflected in the price. No other complaints. My son is well happy with this.; Cool refreshing drink, never had raspberry before usually buy lemon, but thought I try a different one, glad i did, each bottle had a recommended retail price of 1 pound so it was in a 12 bottle pack but I paid more than 12 pound for it all, which I thought was a bit of a cheek really. With FREE PRIME DELIVERY; I really love the taste and it really quenches your thirst, the only negative thing is its not big enough for me, it should be in Litres sizes say a ten litre packs and the prices to go up to recognise the larger size, hope this helps.; Absolutely love this soft drink, so quenching! Great price & quick delivery time", Good favoured Iced Tea,"Very nice favour, very refreshing when chilled. However the price is a little high when ordering from Amazon."

5.0 out of 5 stars Great product but why does the price keep going up?, Great product","I love these - especially as they are sugar free. But why does the price keep jumping from £15.60 to £21? That's a huge increase; I first had this flavour when i was on holiday in New York and i was in love with the flavours. So when i got back to UK i tried my best to try and find this flavour but i was met with very expensive bottles.
When i saw the sugar free bottles of snapple in the same flavours i had to give it a try. The prices were way cheaper than the shops so i got some. I can say that the flavours isnt as strong but it is sugar free.
Im actually quite enjoying the flavour now.",,

I've got a bias towards ginger based ones. This one is by far the best I've tried. True ginger flavour without any sort of artificial sweetner aftertaste (I try to avoid those ones as I prefer them less). Flavor excellent (although I haven't tried any of the other falvours from Equinox). Comes in a can which is convenient for bringing to BBQs or the beach. Nice that it's organic although it doesn't make a difference to me. Just wish a better discount option was available for bulk purchases, I'd be inclined to do larger monthly orders.

Edit: In the few weeks since writing this review, the price has increased from £1.50 to £2.25. For this reason, it is now 3-stars. Will no longer be buying as there are other similar products with prices like the old one.; Lovely to drink, shame about the price.",,
